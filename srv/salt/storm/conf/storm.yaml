#small amounts of state (like jars, confs, and things like that). You should create that directory

#For each worker machine, you configure how many workers run on that machine with this config. 
#Each worker uses a single port for receiving messages, and this setting defines which ports are open for use. 
#If you define five ports here, then Storm will allocate up to five workers to run on this machine. 
#If you define three ports, Storm will only run up to three. 
#By default, this setting is configured to run 4 workers on the ports 6700, 6701, 6702, and 6703.
